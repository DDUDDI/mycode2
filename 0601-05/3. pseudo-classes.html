            A couple of pseudo-classes can also be used to apply styles to content based on
            its position on the page. For example, the :first-letter pseudo-class
            selects only the first letter in each of the elements selected by the selector.
            Likewise, the :first-line pseudo-class selects the first line of text in the
            element.
